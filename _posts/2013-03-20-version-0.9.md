Version 0.9.0 is now available.

### New distribution method

The PEAR channel has been abandoned, and replaced with a much simpler distribution method: you download a single Phar archive. Done.

Of course, installing via git is still possible and encouraged, if you want to hack on WP-CLI.

The [front page](/) has up-to-date information about all the supported installation methods.

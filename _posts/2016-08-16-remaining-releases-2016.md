title: Two more major releases in 2016
---

Just a heads up there will be two more major releases in 2016:

* v0.25.0 will be released on Tuesday, October 25th.
* v1.0.0 will be released on Tuesday, November 29th.

Want to help out? We'll be focusing on framework refinement; in particular, there are a [number of improvements that can be made](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acommand%3Apackage) to the package management experience.

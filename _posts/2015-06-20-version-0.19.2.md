title: Version 0.19.2 released
---

Embarrassingly, [WP-CLI v0.19.1](http://wp-cli.org/blog/version-0.19.1.html) introduced another bug related to scaffolding plugin tests. More embarrassingly, it took me a full month to get around to fixing it. My apologies if you were bit by it.

You can browse the full list of [resolved issues](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues?milestone=31&page=1&state=closed) on Github.

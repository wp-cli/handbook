# wp shell

Opens an interactive PHP console for running and testing PHP code.

`wp shell` allows you to evaluate PHP statements and expressions interactively, from within a WordPress environment. Type a bit of code, hit enter, and see the code execute right before you. Because WordPress is loaded, you have access to all the functions, classes and globals that you can use within a WordPress plugin, for example.

### OPTIONS

[\--basic]
: Force the use of WP-CLI's built-in PHP REPL, even if the Boris or PsySH PHP REPLs are available.

### EXAMPLES

    # Call get_bloginfo() to get the name of the site.
    $ wp shell
    wp> get_bloginfo( 'name' );
    => string(6) "WP-CLI"

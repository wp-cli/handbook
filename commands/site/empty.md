# wp site empty

Empties a site of its content (posts, comments, terms, links, and meta).

Truncates posts, comments, terms, and links tables to empty a site of its content. Doesn't affect site configuration (options) or users.

Flushes the object cache after emptying the site to ensure stale data is not served. On a Multisite installation, this will flush the cache for all sites.

To also empty custom database tables, you'll need to hook into command execution:

```
WP_CLI::add_hook( 'after_invoke:site empty', function(){
    global $wpdb;
    foreach( array( 'p2p', 'p2pmeta' ) as $table ) {
        $table = $wpdb-&gt;$table;
        $wpdb-&gt;query( "TRUNCATE $table" );
    }
});
```

### OPTIONS

See the [argument syntax](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/references/argument-syntax/) reference for a detailed explanation of the syntax conventions used.

[\--uploads]
: Also delete *all* files in the site's uploads directory.

[\--yes]
: Proceed to empty the site without a confirmation prompt.

### EXAMPLES

    $ wp site empty
    Are you sure you want to empty the site at http://www.example.com of all posts, links, comments, and terms? [y/n] y
    Success: The site at 'http://www.example.com' was emptied.

# wp core upgrade

Updates WordPress to a newer version.

This is an alias for `wp core update`.

Defaults to updating WordPress to the latest version.

If you see "Error: Another update is currently in progress.", you may need to run `wp option delete core_updater.lock` after verifying another update isn't actually running.

### OPTIONS

See the [argument syntax](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/references/argument-syntax/) reference for a detailed explanation of the syntax conventions used.

# wp theme install

Installs one or more themes.

### OPTIONS

&lt;theme|zip|url&gt;...
: One or more themes to install. Accepts a theme slug, the path to a local zip file, or a URL to a remote zip file.

[\--version=&lt;version&gt;]
: If set, get that particular version from wordpress.org, instead of the stable version.

[\--force]
: If set, the command will overwrite any installed version of the theme, without prompting for confirmation.

[\--activate]
: If set, the theme will be activated immediately after install.

[\--insecure]
: Retry downloads without certificate validation if TLS handshake fails. Note: This makes the request vulnerable to a MITM attack.

**wp-cli** is a set of command-line tools for managing [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) installations. You can update plugins, set up multisite installs, create posts and much more.

Requirements
============

* PHP >= 5.3
* WordPress >= 3.3

Installing
==========

**Via PEAR:**

<pre>
sudo pear channel-discover wp-cli.org/pear
sudo pear install wpcli/wpcli
</pre>

**Via GIT:**

<pre>
git clone --recursive git://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli.git ~/git/wp-cli
cd ~/git/wp-cli
sudo utils/dev-build
</pre>

You can replace `~/git/wp-cli` with whatever you want.

MAMP, XAMP, etc.
-----------

If the `php` command is not available, you can try finding an appropriate binary:

<pre>
./utils/find-php
</pre>

Then, create an environment variable called `WP_CLI_PHP` with the path found by `find-php`.

In a UNIX environment, you would do this by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` file:

<pre>
WP_CLI_PHP=/path/to/php-binary
</pre>

Using
=====

Go into a WordPress root folder:

<pre>
cd /var/www/wp/
</pre>

Typing `wp` should show you output similar to this:

<pre>
Available commands:
    wp blog create|delete
    wp cache add|decr|delete|flush|get|incr|replace|set|type
    wp comment create|delete|trash|untrash|spam|unspam|approve|unapprove|count|status|last
    wp core download|config|is-installed|install|install-network|version|update|update-db
    wp db create|drop|reset|optimize|repair|connect|cli|query|export|import
    wp eval-file
    ...

See 'wp help &lt;command&gt;' for more information on a specific command.
</pre>

Let's try to install the Hello Dolly plugin from wordpress.org:

<pre>
wp plugin install hello-dolly
</pre>

Output:

<pre>
Installing Hello Dolly (1.5)

Downloading install package from http://downloads.WordPress.org/plugin/hello-dolly.1.5.zip ...
Unpacking the package ...
Installing the plugin ...
Plugin installed successfully.
</pre>

Multisite
---------

On a multisite installation, you need to pass a `--blog` parameter, so that wp-cli knows which site it's supposed to be operating on:

<pre>
wp theme status --blog=localhost/wp/test
</pre>

If you have a subdomain installation, it would look like this:

<pre>
wp theme status --blog=test.example.com
</pre>

If you're usually working on the same site most of the time, you can put the url of that site in a file called 'wp-cli-blog' in your root WP dir:

<pre>
echo 'test.example.com' > wp-cli-blog
</pre>

Then, you can call `wp` without the `--blog` parameter again:

<pre>
wp theme status
</pre>

Adding commands
===============

Adding commands to wp-cli is very easy. You can even add them from within your own plugin.
You can find more information about adding commands in the [Commands Cookbook](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/wiki/Commands-Cookbook) on our Wiki.

**Please share the commands you make, issue a pull request to get them included in wp-cli by default.**
